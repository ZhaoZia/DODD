# DODD

**Disaster Occlusion Detection Dataset (DODD)**

## Dataset Description

The Disaster Occlusion Detection Dataset (DODD) is a specialized dataset created to enhance the study of human detection in occlusion-heavy disaster environments. This dataset was developed by combining images from multiple publicly accessible datasets to create challenging occlusion-heavy scenes.

## Composition of the Dataset

DODD is a compilation of images from multiple publicly accessible datasets, selected and assembled to create challenging occlusion-heavy scenes. The dataset includes a total of 121 images, featuring:
- **101 negative samples. Individuals partially occluded by environmental elements** such as debris, vegetation, and floodwater.
- **20 negative samples** (images without any human presence), to serve as control cases for evaluation.

## Source Datasets

The datasets used to create DODD include:
- **Saied Fire Dataset**: Focused on occlusions caused by smoke and fire in disaster environments. Available at: [Kaggle - Saied Fire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset?select=...)
- **Telperion DisasterDatasetRaw**: Used for additional scenes involving natural disaster conditions like earthquakes and floods. Available at: [Kaggle - Telperion DisasterDatasetRaw](https://kaggle.com/dat...)

Each dataset was selected to ensure that DODD features realistic and complex scenarios to rigorously test human detection models in occluded environments.
